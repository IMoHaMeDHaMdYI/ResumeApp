# ResumeApp

I created this app while trying to get myself familiar with some android apis that I didn't engage with.
<h3>First there is the retrofitrxcomponentarch package  I used :<br></h3>
    <h4><ul>
    <li>PagedList<br></li>
    <li>Paging library</li>
    </ul></h4>
 This is the only package I'm proud of how the code is written and its archeticture 'cause This was the most important concern while
I was writing this package

<h3> Then comes the mediaplayer package I Learnt almost all about mediacompat and exoplayer.</h3>

<h3> In The alarm package I only was reminding myself of how the broadcastreceiver works.</h3>

<h3> In The imageeditor package I was learning camera2 api and trying some filter libraries.</h3>
